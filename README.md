<h1>explor</h1>

<p>A Ruby On Rails App built by <a href="https://github.com/jsakalys">Julie Sakalys</a>, <a href="https://github.com/abautist">Auggie Bautista</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BrittanyIRL">Brittany Brassell</a> for General Assembly WDI 2015. </p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Fuel your wanderlust with just one click. Channeling the search results for everything from popular landmarks, good eats, weather, and beautiful pictures so that you can spend more time adventuring, and less time researching.</p>

<h2>Known bugs</h2>
<p>There's a lot going on here. So, sometimes things break. Error handling initially broke our site, so we need to find a new way to handle unknown pathes.</p>

<h2>Things to add</h2>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, Explor is intended to help travelers plan trips efficiently from either the road or at home - helping people who plan and travel in all sorts of ways. In the future, there will be more ways to organize and safe things to do as well as a community functionality that allows people to share what they learn with others - combining the usefulness of things like yelp, trip advisor, and pinterest, and taking some of the time it takes to find all of these out of the whole of it!</p>
